# Overrides

To rebrand the extension with Cozy colors and add features specific to Cozy,
we override some of the components of the original Bitwarden browser extension.
The way we do these overrides is by extending some classes and add or change
some methods in it.

The purpose of this document is to list all the overrides, so we have a global
vision of what we did.

## Login

### Replace email/password with cozy instance/password

To login, we ask the user to enter his cozy instance URL instead of an email address.

## Password generation tab

### Hide generation options

Generation options are hidden by default (still accessible after a click).

### Place the regenerate and copy actions next to the password

These two actions are located under the password in Bitwarden extension. For us,
the actions are icons placed next to the password.

### Automatically copy the password to the clipboard

When the user goes to the generate tab, the generated password is directly
copied in his clipboard.

## "My vault" tab

### Reorganize vault display

We made some change to be able to show all logins in the vault : by removing favorite feature, folders and collections.
We replaced the icons displayed by bitwarden with Cozy icons for card paiements ( with Cozy Banks logo) and identity (with Cozy Contact logo). 

There has also been a small change in the "tab" tab to group in a single section the identity and payment cards sections.

### Highlight ciphers shared with cozy organization

We add a cozy icon on ciphers that are shared with cozy organization.

## Notification bar

### Restyle the notification bar to fit our needs

When we show a notification because we detected that some credentials can be
added to the vault, we want a specific look and feel.

## Konnectors suggestions

Based on the brands present in the user's vault, we automatically create some apps
and konnectors install suggestions.

## Autofill and save password popup improvements

We worked a lot on autofill so it handles more websites than the Bitwarden
extension. Also on "save password" popup because it was not showing on several
websites.

## OAuth client

### Update synchronized_at on oauth client

Since the oauth client used to connect the extension to the cozy instance is
displayed in cozy-settings, we want to show its last synchronization date. To
achieve this, we needed to add some calls to the stack.

### Set client name according to the browser being used

We cant the OAuth client to have a name that reflects the browser in which the
extension is used (firefox, chrome).

### Remove OAuth client on logout

On login, the OAuth client is created by the stack. On logout, there is no call
to a "logout" route. Everything is done on client side, so the client was never
removed. We added a call to the stack to remove the client on logout.

## Export

### Export all ciphers

In the Bitwarden extension, ciphers that are shared with an organization are not
part of the ciphers being exported. In our case, we want to export all the
ciphers, even the one shared with the cozy organization.

## Extension status

To work in pair with the cozy-passwords app, we needed the extension to be able
to report its own status (installed, connected) via a messaging mechanism with
an app.

* https://github.com/cozy/cozy-keys-browser/pull/72

## Features removed

We don't support some features present in the Bitwarden extension.
